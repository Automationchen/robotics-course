    "```\n",
    "(FS.position, {'hand'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "is the 3D position of the hand in world coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(FS.positionRel, {'handL', 'handR'}, scale=[[0,0,1]], target=[0.1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "is the z-position position of the left hand measured in the frame of the right hand, with target 10centimeters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(FS.position, {'handL'}, order=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "is the 3D velocity of the left hand in world coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(FS.scalarProductXX, {'handL', 'handR'}, target=[1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "says that the scalar product of the x-axes (e.g. directions of the index finger) of both hands should equal 1, which means they are aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(FS.scalarProductXY, {'handL', 'handR'})\n",
    "(FS.scalarProductXZ, {'handL', 'handR'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "says that the the x-axis of handL should be orthogonal (zero scalar product) to the y- and z-axis of handR. So this also describes aligning both z-axes. However, this formulation is much more robust, as it has good error gradients around the optimum.\n",

    "\\in\\{\\texttt{ineq, eq, sos}\\}$ that states whether the features\n",
    "implies an inequality, an equality, or a sum-of-square objective\n",
    "* and an index tuple $\\pi_k \\subseteq \\{1,..,n\\}$ that states which\n",
    "configurations this feature is defined over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, given a set\n",
    "$\\{\\phi_1,..,\\phi_K\\}$ of $K$ features, and a set $\\{x_1,..,x_n\\}$ of\n",
    "$n$ configurations, this defines the mathematical program\n",
